On my profil, you'll find multiple repos of my work as Computal Neurosciences trainee and my Data Science Portfolio showcasing my skills and expertise in the field through differents data projets I did to sharpen my data skills.

# About me
  
- My current work as a Data Scientist is focusing on **better understanding and getting the most out of databases to make data-driven decisions and answer buisness questions**. To do this, I builded a strong technical stack/fondation based on multiple Data Science and Artificial Intelligence experiences as Computational Neuroscientist in public research at the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). To do this, I mainly use Python, Apache Spark, R, Excel/Sheet, Tableau, PowerBI and SQL, but I'm open to try out other tools if a project requires it.
- I previously worked on **developping a large scale SNN** of around 4 millions neurons with cognitve applications, mainly language processing and brain oscillations, as part of my master internship at the CerCo with Simon Thorpe and Aditya Kar using **Swift** and **Metal Shading Language**. This work, still in progess, can be found here : https://github.com/karaditya/SNN-JAST-SpikeNet and in a peer-reviewed article comming soon in 2024.
- Fan of 3D modelling since I was little, I have previous work and personnal (modding) experience with 3D engines like **Unity** and **Blender3D**, aswell as programming experience with largely **Python** and **R** and a little bit with **Matlab** and **C++**.
